TASK

Produce a comprehensive field briefing (> 50 000 words) that maps today’s and near-term (< 3 yrs) methods for detecting AI-generated content in text, images, video, and voice—with an explicit focus on:
	1.	Actions end-users can take right now (e.g., journalists, social-media moderators, K-12 educators, enterprise knowledge-workers).
	2.	Solutions developers could build next (open-source libraries, browser plug-ins, mobile apps, SaaS APIs, hardware add-ons) including feasibility, architecture sketches, and R&D roadmaps.

CONTEXT / BACKGROUND

The spread of synthetic media is eroding trust in social-media and information platforms. While detector research is advancing, practical guidance for everyday users—and a clear product roadmap for tool-builders—remains fragmented. This project will inform product strategy and potential open-source collaboration.

SPECIFIC QUESTIONS / SUBTASKS
	1.	Modality-by-Modality Landscape
	•	Current state-of-the-art detectors, accuracy benchmarks, typical false-positive/negative rates.
	•	Practical “how-to” guides for non-technical users (step-by-step, screenshots, heuristics).
	2.	End-User Playbooks
	•	Checklists & decision trees for verifying authenticity on social-media posts, videos, voice clips.
	•	Comparison tables of publicly available tools (cost, ease of use, platform coverage).
	3.	Builder-Focused Solution Space
	•	Gaps in the market; pain points users still face.
	•	Detailed blueprints for immediately buildable products (libraries, plug-ins) and futuristic concepts (TEE-signed cameras, ZK watermark proofs).
	4.	Effectiveness & Risks
	•	Known circumvention tactics; arms-race dynamics; legal/privacy constraints.
	•	Risk-benefit analysis for mandatory provenance standards (C2PA, SynthID).
	5.	Roadmaps & Recommendations
	•	Short-term (0-12 mo) MVPs; mid-term (1-3 yr) advanced R&D.
	•	Policy, standards, and ecosystem enablers required for adoption.

KEYWORDS

AI content detection, watermarking, C2PA, SynthID, deepfake forensics, provenance, social-media verification, end-user tools, browser extensions, zero-knowledge proofs, trusted execution, hardware attestation

CONSTRAINTS
	•	Timeframe: emphasise 2023-June 2025 literature + near-term forecasts to 2028.
	•	Domain: media & social-media information flows (global).
	•	Sources: peer-reviewed papers, patents, standards drafts (C2PA, W3C), industry white-papers, credible tech blogs, policy briefs.
	•	Length: ≥ 50 000 words total; include modular sections that can standalone.
	•	Visuals: flow-charts, comparison matrices, roadmap timelines (ASCII or Mermaid OK).
	•	Citation: inline numeric superscripts, full bibliography.

OUTPUT FORMAT
	1.	Executive Summary (≤ 1 500 words).
	2.	Main Report divided into clearly numbered parts & sub-parts.
	3.	End-User Quick-Reference Toolkit (checklists, cheat-sheets).
	4.	Developer Solution Blueprints (architecture diagrams, pseudo-code snippets).
	5.	Roadmap Tables (short-/mid-term).
	6.	Appendices (detailed benchmarks, data tables, glossary).
	7.	All visuals embedded as Markdown images or Mermaid diagrams.

FINAL INSTRUCTIONS

Be exhaustive yet readable; favour plain language for end-user sections, technical depth for developer appendices. Highlight controversies and open questions. Ask follow-up questions if any scope point is ambiguous.

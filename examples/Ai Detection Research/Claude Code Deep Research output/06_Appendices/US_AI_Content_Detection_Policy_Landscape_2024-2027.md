# US Policy Landscape for AI Content Detection and Synthetic Media Regulation (2024-2027)

## Executive Summary

The United States is experiencing a rapidly evolving policy landscape for AI content detection and synthetic media regulation. While federal legislation remains fragmented with multiple proposed bills but limited enacted laws, state governments—particularly California—have taken aggressive action. The regulatory environment shifted significantly with the Trump administration's January 2025 revocation of Biden's Executive Order 14110, signaling a move from safety-focused governance to innovation-driven policy. Key trends include mandatory content labeling, platform liability frameworks modeled after DMCA safe harbors, and increasing penalties for non-consensual intimate imagery deepfakes.

## Conclusion

The US policy landscape for AI content detection and synthetic media regulation remains fragmented but is rapidly evolving. While federal action has been limited, state initiatives—particularly in California—are driving significant compliance requirements. The shift from the Biden to Trump administration signals a move toward less prescriptive regulation, though bipartisan support exists for addressing non-consensual intimate imagery. Organizations must prepare for a complex patchwork of requirements while anticipating more comprehensive federal legislation by 2027. Success will require balancing innovation, free expression, privacy protection, and harm prevention in an increasingly AI-mediated information environment.

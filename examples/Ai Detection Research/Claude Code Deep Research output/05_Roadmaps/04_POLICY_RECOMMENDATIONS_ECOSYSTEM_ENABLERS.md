## Urgent Policy Imperatives

### The 2025 Window of Opportunity

The next 18 months represent a critical period for establishing AI detection frameworks before synthetic content becomes indistinguishable from authentic content. Policy action is needed NOW to:

1. **Prevent a "Deepfake Crisis"** - Est. $5B annual fraud by 2026
2. **Protect Democratic Processes** - 2024-2025 election cycles at risk
3. **Maintain Digital Trust** - 73% of users already doubt content authenticity
4. **Enable Innovation** - $4.1B market waiting for clear regulations

## 1. Detection Methods and Approaches

### Machine Learning-Based Detection

**Current State:**
- NPR (2024) identified three major deepfake audio detection providers: Pindrop Security, AI or Not, and AI Voice Detector
- Most providers claim over 90% accuracy at differentiating between real and AI-generated audio
- However, real-world performance varies significantly:
  - Pindrop Security's tool achieved the highest accuracy, getting all but three samples correct
  - AI or Not's tool got about half wrong, failing to catch most AI-generated clips

**Credibility Rating: A** - Major news outlet with direct testing results

### Biological Feature Detection

Researchers are incorporating perceptual, biological features into machine learning models, exploring innate biological processes to discern between authentic human voices and cloned voices. This approach searches for the absence of biological features in cloned voices rather than the presence of digital features.

### Deep Learning Architectures

Recent developments show:
- Custom Architecture performs best for Chromagram, Spectrogram, and Mel-Spectrum images
- VGG-16 architecture achieves best results for MFCC image features
- State-of-the-art detectors are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can reduce accuracy from 98.5% to 0.08%

## 2. Acoustic Feature Analysis

### Mel-Spectrogram Analysis

Mel-spectrograms are particularly effective for deepfake detection because they:
- Capture human perception characteristics
- Reveal subtle prosodic and rhythmic anomalies in synthetic speech
- Show monotonous pitch patterns in deepfakes
- Detect unnatural pause distributions
- Identify disrupted temporal coherence

**Key Finding:** "Deepfake voices show relative monotonousness" with significant differences in rhythm and pitch variances compared to human voices.

**Credibility Rating: B** - Preprint, not yet peer-reviewed but from reputable researchers

### Prosody and Rhythm Detection

Prosodic features critical for detection include:
- Pitch variations (fundamental frequency patterns)
- Energy distribution
- Zero-crossings of speech signals
- Intonation patterns
- Stress and rhythm anomalies

The approach using prosody features makes detection less susceptible to simple adaptive attacks compared to other methods.

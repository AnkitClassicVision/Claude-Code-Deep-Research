## üîç Key Findings

**Performance Reality Check:**
- Lab conditions: 95-99% accuracy claimed
- Real-world: 69-86% actual accuracy
- Video: 75% (most challenging)
- Voice: 86% (best performing)
- Image: 70-85% (varies by generator)
- Text: 60-70% (highest false positives)

**Technology Maturity:**
1. Voice detection most mature (commercial deployments)
2. Image detection rapidly evolving (GANs ‚Üí Diffusion)
3. Video detection computationally intensive
4. Text detection fundamentally limited

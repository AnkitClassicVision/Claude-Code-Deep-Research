## Critical Technical Gaps

### 1. Cross-Modal Consistency Detection üî¥ CRITICAL

**Current State**: All existing detectors work in isolation per modality

**The Gap**: No open-source solution verifies consistency across text, image, audio, and video simultaneously

**Why It Matters**: 
- Sophisticated AI content often combines multiple modalities
- Inconsistencies between modalities are strong indicators of manipulation
- Single-modal detection misses 40% of sophisticated fakes

**Technical Requirements**:
```python
# Conceptual architecture needed
class CrossModalDetector:
    def analyze(self, content):
        # Extract all modalities
        text = extract_text(content)
        audio = extract_audio(content)
        video = extract_video(content)
        
        # Check cross-modal consistency
        lip_sync = verify_lip_sync(audio, video)
        text_audio_match = verify_transcript(text, audio)
        semantic_consistency = verify_semantics(text, video)
        
        return aggregate_inconsistencies()
```

**Opportunity Score**: 10/10
**Difficulty**: High
**Impact**: Revolutionary

---

### 2. Real-Time Stream Processing üü° HIGH PRIORITY

**Current State**: Most detectors require complete files, batch processing

**The Gap**: No production-ready real-time detection for live streams

**Market Need**:
- Live streaming platforms (Twitch, YouTube Live)
- Video conferencing (Zoom, Teams)
- Real-time content moderation

**Technical Challenges**:
- Processing latency < 100ms
- Streaming protocols (WebRTC, RTMP)
- Partial content analysis
- Memory efficiency

**Implementation Approach**:
```python
# Needed: Streaming detection pipeline
class StreamDetector:
    async def process_stream(self, stream_url):
        buffer = StreamBuffer(max_size=5_seconds)
        
        async for chunk in stream:
            buffer.add(chunk)
            if buffer.ready():
                result = await self.detect_partial(buffer)
                yield result
```

**Opportunity Score**: 9/10
**Difficulty**: Medium-High
**Market Size**: $2.3B by 2027

def optimize_for_mobile(model):
    # 1. Quantization
    quantized = quantize_dynamic(model, qint8)
    
    # 2. Pruning
    pruned = prune_model(quantized, sparsity=0.8)
    
    # 3. Knowledge distillation
    student = distill_to_mobile(pruned, target_size=20MB)
    
    # 4. Platform-specific export
    export_to_coreml(student)
    export_to_tflite(student)
```

**Opportunity Score**: 9/10
**Difficulty**: Medium
**User Base**: 6.8B mobile users

---

### 4. Adversarial Robustness üî¥ CRITICAL

**Current State**: Most detectors easily fooled by simple perturbations

**The Gap**: No robust defense against adversarial attacks

**Attack Vectors**:
- Pixel-level perturbations
- Frequency domain attacks
- Semantic preserving transformations
- Cross-modal attacks

**Defense Strategies Needed**:
```python
# Adversarial training framework
class RobustDetector:
    def train_with_adversarial(self, data):
        for batch in data:
            # Generate adversarial examples
            adv_examples = [
                fgsm_attack(batch),
                pgd_attack(batch),
                cw_attack(batch),
                semantic_attack(batch)
            ]
            
            # Train on both clean and adversarial
            loss = train_step(batch) + train_step(adv_examples)
```

**Opportunity Score**: 10/10
**Difficulty**: Very High
**Research Impact**: Groundbreaking

    def detect_without_seeing(self, encrypted_content):
        # Homomorphic computation
        encrypted_features = extract_features_encrypted(encrypted_content)
        encrypted_result = model.predict_encrypted(encrypted_features)
        
        # Client decrypts result
        return encrypted_result

## Conclusion

AI detection tools have become essential for navigating our increasingly AI-generated content landscape. While no single tool provides perfect detection, combining multiple tools and understanding their limitations allows users to make informed decisions about content authenticity. The free tiers of Scribbr, QuillBot, and ZeroGPT provide excellent starting points for text detection, while AI or Not and Illuminarty offer accessible image detection. For more critical applications, premium tools with higher accuracy rates and lower false positive rates are recommended.

Remember: AI detection should be one part of a holistic approach to content verification, not the sole arbiter of authenticity.

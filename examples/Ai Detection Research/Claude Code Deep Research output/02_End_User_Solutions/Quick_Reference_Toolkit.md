# AI Detection Quick Reference Toolkit

## 🚨 Emergency Detection Checklist

### Suspect AI-Generated Content? Follow These Steps:

1. **Never rely on a single detection tool** - Use at least 2-3 different detectors
2. **Check multiple aspects** - Look for consistency across text, metadata, and context
3. **Consider the source** - Verified accounts and known sources are more trustworthy
4. **Look for telltale signs** - Perfect symmetry, impossible physics, uncanny valley effects
5. **When in doubt, verify independently** - Contact the supposed source directly

2. **Request Human Review** - Demand a person, not just AI, reviews your work
3. **Provide Context** - Explain your writing process, show sources
4. **Know Your Rights** - Many institutions have policies against AI-only decisions
5. **Seek Support** - Contact advocacy groups if facing discrimination

### Avoid These If Privacy Matters:

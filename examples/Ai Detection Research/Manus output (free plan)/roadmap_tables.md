| **Mobile App for Multi-Modal Analysis** | Mobile application for uploading/sharing text, image, audio, video for AI detection. | Multi-modal input, confidence scores, educational tips, secure handling. | K-12 educators, enterprise knowledge-workers, general public. | High | Accessible on-the-go content verification, enhanced media literacy for mobile users. |
| **Open-Source Library for Text & Image Detection** | Modular Python library with open-source models for AI text and image detection. | Pre-trained models, feature extraction utilities, clear documentation, community guidelines. | Developers, researchers, academic institutions. | High | Accelerated development of custom detection tools, increased transparency and collaboration in the field. |

### Mid-Term (1-3 Years) Advanced R&D Roadmap

| Initiative | Description | Key Challenges | Potential Applications | Metrics of Success |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Real-time Deepfake Detection (Live Streams)** | Low-latency, high-accuracy deepfake detection for live video and audio streams. | Computational intensity, privacy, adapting to new deepfake techniques. | Live news broadcasts, online meetings, social media live streams. | Reduced latency, improved accuracy on live deepfakes, successful platform integrations. |
| **Advanced Multi-Modal Inconsistency Detection** | AI models detecting subtle inconsistencies *between* modalities (e.g., video visual vs. audio). | Training complex multi-modal models, diverse datasets, interpretability. | Comprehensive content verification for complex media. | Improved accuracy on multi-modal deepfakes, precise anomaly identification. |
| **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Watermark Verification** | Privacy-preserving verification of watermarks in AIGC without revealing sensitive data. | Computational overhead, efficient ZKP schemes for complex data. | Secure content authentication, privacy-preserving content sharing. | Feasibility of ZKP generation/verification, reduced computational cost, pilot implementations. |
| **Hardware-Assisted Provenance & Attestation** | Integration of TEEs in cameras or dedicated AI detection chips for secure content origin. | Standardization across vendors, secure key management, hardware cost. | Authenticity at point of capture, high-volume content verification. | Successful hardware prototypes, industry partnerships, open standards development. |
